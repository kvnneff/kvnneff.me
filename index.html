      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>Work History</h2>
      <h4>Civic Maker Lab (June 2015 - July 2015)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> node.js, AWS S3
      </p>

      <p>
        I was contracted by <a href="http://civicmakerlab.com/">Civic Maker Lab</a> to create an open-source plugin for their CMS <a href="https://github.com/civicmakerlab/township">Township</a>. The plugin allows Township authors to upload media files to be embedded in
        posts and has the capability to store the files either to the server's
        file system or to an AWS S3 bucket.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plugin has been open-sourced on Github: <a href="https://github.com/kvnneff/township-media">township-media</a>
      </p>


      <h4>Brown Paper Tickets (2008 - 2015)</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> TCL, PostgreSQL, Javascript, CSS, node.js
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2008 I joined <a href="https://brownpapertickets.com">Brown Paper Tickets</a> as a weekend call-center representative and over the years pushed myself to learn and grow, advancing into positions the positions of Client Services Representative, Client Tech Support Representative,
        Client Tech Support Manager, Office Tech Support Representative and
        eventually I became a self-taught front-end and TCL developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My last 3 years at Brown Paper Tickets were spent within a small
        team of developers and designers that worked to improve and expand the
        front-end and back-end of the Brown Paper Tickets website.  I worked with TCL and PostgreSQL on the server and HTML, CSS and Javascript on the front-end.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my down time I experimented with node.js and I proposed creating an app with it that would allow Brown Paper Tickets employees to easily create new seating charts for venues, a process that had previously been done by entering rows of data manually into a spreadsheet and could take a single employee multiple days to finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was given full-reign to pursue this project on my own an created an HTML5 Canvas point & click interface that enabled Brown Paper Tickets employees to lay out a seating chart, quickly apply meta-data to individual rows and seats, and use a Euclidean algorythm to automatically generate seat desirability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app was powered by a node.js server that stored the finished seating charts in a CouchDB database.
      </p>

      <p>
        A multiplayer Tetris game built with <a href="https://github.com/dekujs/deku">Deku</a>
        (a React-like framework), Browserify and <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron">Electron</a>. I created this in my free time in order to experiment with Web Sockets. Players connect to a centralized server which receives data from each connected client and redistributes that data to keep the game in sync.
