    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      I'm a front-end and node.js developer living on a small homestead in
      rural Williams, OR.
    </p>

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      In 2008 I joined <a href="https://brownpapertickets.com">Brown Paper Tickets</a> as a weekend call-center representative
      and over the years pushed myself to learn and grow, advancing into titles
      such as Client Services Representative, Client Tech Support Representative,
      Client Tech Support Manager, Office Tech Support Representative and
      eventually I became a self-taught Full-Stack Developer.
    </p>

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      For my last 3 years at Brown Paper Tickets I participated within a small
      team of developers and designers that worked to improve and expand the
      front-end and back-end of the Brown Paper Tickets website.  I worked with
      TCL and PostgreSQL on the server and HTML, CSS and Javascript on the
      client side of things.
    </p>

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      In my down time I experimented with node.js and a more modular approach
      to coding and became hooked.  I had an idea to create a graphical user
      interface that would allow Brown Paper Tickets employees to easily create
      new seating charts for venues, a process that had previously been done by
      entering hundreds of rows of data manually into a spreadsheet and could
      take a single employee multiple days to finish.
    </p>

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      Given full-reign to pursue this side project on my own, I leveraged the
      power of node.js, npm, and front-end packagers such as <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>
      and <a href="http://duojs.org/">Duo</a> to create an HTML5 Canvas point & click interface that enabled
      Brown Paper Tickets employees to lay out a seating chart, name the rows
      and seats and calculate seat desirability in under an hour, saving Brown
      Paper Tickets hundreds of man-hours.
    </p>

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      In 2015 I left Brown Paper Tickets to seek out more opportunities to work
      with codebases and projects that utilize Javascript and modularity on both
      the back-end and front-end.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy lifting weights, hunting, gardening, raising
      chickens and rabbits, and dungeon mastering a
      <a href="http://schwalbentertainment.com/shadow-of-the-demon-lord/">Shadow of the Demon Lord</a>
      campaign for friends.

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      A multiplayer Tetris game built with <a href="https://github.com/dekujs/deku">Deku</a>
      (a React-like framework), Browserify and <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron">Electron</a>.
      I created this in my free time in order to experiment with Web Sockets.
      Players connect to a centralized server which receives data from each
      connected client and redistributes that data to keep the game in sync.

    <p class="Main-paragraph">
      I was contracted by <a href="http://civicmakerlab.com/">Civic Maker Lab</a>
      to create a plugin for their CMS <a href="https://github.com/civicmakerlab/township">Township</a>.
      The plugin allows Township authors to upload media files to be embedded in
      posts and has the capability to store the files either to the server's
      file system or to an AWS S3 bucket.
