      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a web developer living on a farm in Williams, Oregon.  I make web
        applications, usually with Node.js but sometimes with TCL.  I'm available for hire
        on a freelance basis.

        I was tasked with writing the back-end code for a new event approval
        system that ran 60+ checks against a newly submitted event.  Events
        were previously checked manually by Brown Paper Tickets staffers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new event approval system runs a series of checks against the event
        data and records both the aggregate of the results as well as individual
        results of each test in PostgreSQL.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also wrote JSON api routes that would allow Brown Paper Tickets staff to
        trigger the running of the checks, view the check results, as well as
        override the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although it was not required I wrote unit tests for each check in order
        to ease testing and verify that the checks returned valid results.

        I Created an open-source plugin for their CMS <a href="https://github.com/township">Township</a>.
        The plugin allows Township authors to upload media files to be embedded in
        posts and has the capability to store the files either to the server's
        file system or to an AWS S3 bucket.

        In 2008 I joined <a href="https://brownpapertickets.com">Brown Paper Tickets</a>
        as a weekend call-center representative and over the years pushed myself
        to learn and grow.  I advanced into the positions of Client Services
        Representative, Client Tech Support Representative, Client Tech Support
        Manager, and Office Tech Support Representative before I was asked to join
        the development team.
      </p>

      <p>
        My last 3 years at Brown Paper Tickets were spent within a small
        team of developers and designers that worked to improve and expand the
        front-end and back-end of the Brown Paper Tickets website.  I worked
        with TCL and PostgreSQL on the server and HTML, CSS and Javascript on
        the front-end.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my down time I experimented with Node.js and created a proposal for
        an app that would allow Brown Paper Tickets employees to easily create
        new seating charts for venues, a process that had previously been done
        by entering rows of data manually into a spreadsheet and would take a
        single employee multiple days to finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was given full-reign to pursue this project on my own and created an
        HTML5 Canvas point & click interface that enabled Brown Paper Tickets
        employees to quickly lay out a seating chart, apply meta-data to
        individual rows and seats, and use a Euclidean algorythm to automatically
        generate seat desirability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app was powered by a Node.js server that stored the finished seating
        charts in a CouchDB database.  The app state was distributed to each
        connected client using PouchDB/CouchDB's replication features so updates
        to a chart's data could be viewed by others in real-time.

Players connect to a centralized server which receives data from each connected client and redistributes that data to keep the games in sync.
